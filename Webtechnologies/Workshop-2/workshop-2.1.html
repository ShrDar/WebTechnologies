            <dt>AI : </dt>
            <dd>(AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition.      -<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank"><cite> Britannica</cite></a></dd>

            <dt>Cloud Computing : </dt>
            <dd>Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and typically uses a "pay as you go" model, which can help in reducing capital expenses but may also lead to unexpected operating expenses for users. -<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" target="_blank"><cite>  Wikipedia</cite></a></dd>

            <dt>IOT(Internet of Things) : </dt>
            <dd>The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. These devices range from ordinary household objects to sophisticated industrial tools. With more than 7 billion connected IoT devices today, experts are expecting this number to grow to 10 billion by 2020 and 22 billion by 2025. -<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.oracle.com/internet-of-things/what-is-iot/" target="_blank"><cite>  Oracle</cite></a></dd>

            <dd>Big data is a combination of structured, semistructured and unstructured data collected by organizations that can be mined for information and used in machine learning projects, predictive modeling and other advanced analytics applications.Although big data doesn't equate to any specific volume of data, big data deployments often involve terabytes, petabytes and even exabytes of data created and collected over time. -<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/big-data" target="_blank"><cite>  TechTarget</cite></a></dd>

            <dt>Robotics</dt>
            <dd>Robotics is the intersection of science, engineering and technology that produces machines, called robots, that replicate or substitute for human actions. Pop culture has always been fascinated with robots — examples include R2-D2, the Terminator and WALL-E. These over-exaggerated, humanoid concepts of robots usually seem like a caricature of the real thing. But are they more forward thinking than we realize? Robots are gaining intellectual and mechanical capabilities that don’t put the possibility of a R2-D2-like machine out of reach in the future. -<a rel="nofollow" href="https://builtin.com/robotics" target="_blank"><cite>  BuiltIn</cite></a></dd>
